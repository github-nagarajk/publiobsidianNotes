    The given code snippet creates or replaces a view named "SVW_CDC_CONTACT_INTERNAL_KAFKA" in the schema "MDM_USR". This view retrieves data from multiple tables and applies some logic to filter and join the records. Here is a breakdown of the code:

The view has the following columns:

-   CONT_ID
-   CONT_EQUIV_ID
-   ADMIN_CLIENT_ID
-   ADMIN_SYS_TP_CD
-   ADMIN_SYS_NAME
-   LAST_VERIFIED_DT
-   DESCRIPTION
-   SOURCE_CONTACT_GK
-   LAST_UPDATE_DT
-   SEQ
-   MAX_SEQ
-   MERGE_TYPE
-   MC_CONT_EQUIV_ID
-   MC_CONT_ID
-   MC_ADMIN_CLIENT_ID
-   MC_ADMIN_SYS_TP_CD
-   MC_ADMIN_SYS_NAME
-   MC_CONTACTGK
-   MC_LAST_VERIFIED_DT

The view definition uses a common table expression (CTE) named "max_seq" to calculate the maximum sequence ID from various MLOG$ tables. These tables are queried individually, and the maximum sequence ID is determined based on the condition "old_new$$='N'". The results are then combined using the UNION ALL operator.

The main query of the view joins the "max_seq" CTE with several other tables, including MLOG$_CONTEQUIV, MLOG$_PERSONNAME, MLOG$_CPMCONTACTREGISTRY, MLOG$_CPMACCOUNTREGISTRY, MLOG$_CONTACTREL, MLOG$_IDENTIFIER, MLOG$_CONTACT, MLOG$_LOCATIONGROUP, MLOG$_CONTACTMETHOD, MLOG$_CONTACTMETHODGROUP, and MLOG$_XCONTACTROLE.

The join conditions and filters in the main query are based on the "cont_equiv_id" column and the maximum sequence ID obtained from the "max_seq" CTE.

Finally, the view joins the result with another view named "svw_contact_basic_deatils" on the "cont_equiv_id" column.

Overall, this view is designed to retrieve and consolidate data from multiple tables, applying filters and joining conditions to obtain the desired result set.
